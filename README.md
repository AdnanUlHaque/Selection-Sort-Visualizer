I have made my on project Sorting algorithm in which I have made Selection Sort, Cocktail Sort and Insertion Sort algorithm visualizer which I made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We have learned sorting algorithms like the bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quicksort but often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm, maybe because we are unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing to understand about these algorithms is visualization thatâ€™s why I am making this project to let everyone understand how Selection Sorting algorithm, Cocktail Sort Algorithm and Insertion sort work.
